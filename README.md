# Pool Faster
A micro site to onboard non-crypto users to pool together faster.

## Onboarding Flow
* A user can learn about the basics of lotteries and pool together in the first two sections.
* In the last section, the user can actually start to onboard in three stages.
  1. User creates a wallet for himself.
  2. User buys DAI into his wallet using an integrated on-ramp.
  3. Once it's done, the user can go to pool together app and start playing.
  
## Integrations Used
* Fortmatic for wallet creation.
* Transak for on-ramp.

**NOTE:** The on-ramp currently uses a staging environment for testing which can be updated to production if necessary.
